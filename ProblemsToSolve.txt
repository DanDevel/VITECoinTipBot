Development problems waiting to solve:

I could not test create contract and call contract (transfer funds / tip) functions, because i didn't received my vites sent from my vite account on Binance exchange.

I'm still waiting for Vite arrive on pool account to test create and tip functions.

Subscribe and check for subscribe logs functions are working correctilly. All others features are working well.
